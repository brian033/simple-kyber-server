# KyberSwap Aggregator SDK

In order to integrate KyberSwap's DEX Aggregator Swap into your website, you will be using the `@kyberswap/aggregator-sdk`. The goal of the SDK is to help you get the data you need to supply to KyberSwap smart contract's Swap function, which is invoked when users swap on your website.
